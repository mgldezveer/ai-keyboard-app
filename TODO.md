## Known Issues
- [ ] gradle-wrapper.jar is missing - needs to be generated by Android Studio or manually downloaded
- [ ] Launcher icons need actual vector drawable assets

## Next Steps
1. Open project in Android Studio
2. Let Gradle sync (this will generate gradle-wrapper.jar)
3. Create proper app icons using Android Studio's Image Asset Studio
